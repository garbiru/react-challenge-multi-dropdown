### Library and Frameworks
* Heroicons
* React Framer Motion

### What can be improved
* The design of course can be improved, but I'm still a beginner at styling, working my up the ladder
* The animation is pretty basic, it's the first time using React Framer Motion, it seems pretty cool, will use it more.
* Responsiveness can be better, still learning bit by bit how to make everything stick together :)
